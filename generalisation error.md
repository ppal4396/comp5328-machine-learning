# generalisation error 

Formally, this is the difference between expected risk and empirical risk for a hypothesis $h_S$, found from set of training samples $S$. 

$$R(h_S) - R_S(h_S)$$

Although in practice, we do not know the expected risk, and so the term is used informally as the difference in error of a hypothesis between test and training data.
