# COMP5328 Advanced Machine Learning

This repository contains my course notes for COMP5328: Advanced Machine Learning, taken at USYD in 2022. They are reproduced here for future gamers.

I used [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) so the easiest way to view and edit these is probably to clone and open your own vault.
